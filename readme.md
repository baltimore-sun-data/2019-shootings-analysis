## Baltimore Sun analysis

By [Christine Zhang](mailto:czhang@baltsun.com)

The Baltimore Sun conducted the following analysis of Baltimore Police Department Part 1 Victim Based Crime Data posted on [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Part-1-Victim-Based-Crime-Data/wsfq-mvij) on Feb. 22, 2019. The report covers incidents between Jan. 1, 2012, and Feb. 16, 2019.

The analysis provided information for the Feb. 22, 2019 Baltimore Sun story titled ["Thursday's violence in Baltimore was extreme â€” but the number of shootings isn't unprecedented"](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-homicide-record-numbers-20190222-story.html).

The Sun's findings and analysis are available in the "analysis" notebook in this repository, `shootings_analysis.ipynb`.
